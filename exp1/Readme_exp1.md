# Experiment 1 - C++ Flexi Course

## Overview
 This experiment is part of the `cpp-flexi-course`, a comprehensive course designed to help learners master C++ programming. In this experiment, we focus on basic input-output statements, mathematical operators, e.g., "basic syntax and data types in C++".

## Objectives
 - Understand and implement basic C++ syntax.
 - Learn about C++ data types and their usage.
 - Gain hands-on experience by solving practical problems.

## Prerequisites
 Before you begin, make sure you have the following software installed:
 - A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
 - A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, CLion)

## Files and Structure
 The directory structure for `exp1` is as follows:

## Instructions
 To run the program:

 1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `exp1` directory.

## Run the program:
    g++ exp1(name_of_exp).cpp

## Example
    
    g++ exp1a.cpp
    ./a


## Output 
 - Exp1a:
